# Home Repair Services Backend

Welcome to the **Home Repair Services Backend**, built to support a platform where users can offer, book, and manage various home repair services like plumbing, electrical repairs, and carpentry. This backend is developed using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, with **MongoDB** as the database and **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for secure api and authentication.
